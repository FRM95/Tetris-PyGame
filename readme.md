PyGame Tetris Game

Welcome everyone to my very first game, written entirely in Python 3.11.5.
After completing the Tetris technical interview solution, I decided to make a complete Tetris to face a new challenge.

This project was made with the [PyGame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted) library, go and check them for more!
Such a beautiful way to make games in Python, thanks to the PyGame Team and contributors.

I want to thank also to [@programmingwithnick](https://www.youtube.com/@programmingwithnick) for giving me some ideas during this process.

How to play:
1. Install dependencies in requirements.txt
2. Run main.py file
3. Pieces movement with keyboard keys: "s" (down), "d" (right), "a" (left), and "space" (rotate).
